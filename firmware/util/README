the brensenheim demo was used in debugging the implementation -- it didn't
terminate on avr as the (int16_t) < (uint16_t) comparison was implicitly
converted to uint16_t, where negative < positive didn't always return true.
that was especially weird to debug as it worked on x86, where i assume larger
types to be used for performance reasons.
